    Still working on this but basically it involves using a [PolyScience® Smoking Gun](https://www.sousvidetools.com/catalogsearch/result/index/?q=Polyscience®+Smoking+Guns&product_list_order=best_sellers&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI253y_8mY_QIV8o1oCR0hvQgjEAAYAiAAEgKjOfD_BwE) to smoke the flour before making the dough.
