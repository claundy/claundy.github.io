    **Day 1 (evening)**
    1. Add the starter, 100 ml water and 100 g strong white flour to a bowl and mix.
    2. Leave overnight
    
    **Day 2 (morning)**
    1. Add the remaining ingredients and knead well. Probably easiest to use a mixer with a dough hook. You can do it by hand but it will take a while.
    2. Cover with the bowl cling film and leave to ferment for the rest of the day

    **Day 2 (evening)**
    1. Scrape dough onto a lightly floured work surface.
    2. Knock back the large bubbles and shape in to a smooth round ball. Cover with the bowl and leave for 10 min (bench rest)
    4. Repeat the bench rest.
    5. Shape the dough and place in a wel floured proving basket.
    6. Put the whole lot in a large plastic bag (swing bin liner works well). Trap plenty of air in the bag so it's well away from the surface of the dough.
    7. Leave on the bench for an hour or so then place in the fridge over night.

    **Day 3 (morning)**
    1. Place baking stone in oven and pre-heat at 220°C for 30 min or so.
    2. Carefully turn dough out onto piece of baking parchment and score with your favourite pattern.
    3. Place in oven, pour a cup of water on the bottom of the oven and turn down to 160°C
    4. bake for 50 minutes.

My 'go-to' bread recipe!

If there's any left by the end of the week, slice thinly and toast - goes great with some pâté and cheese.
