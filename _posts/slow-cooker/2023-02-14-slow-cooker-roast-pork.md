    **Morning Prep.**

    1. Remove the string. With a sharp knife cut off the skin and place to one side. Trim as much fat from the meat as you can, then re-tie the meat.
    2. Heat a frying pan over a high heat and sear the meat on all sides (don't forget the ends). 
    3. Place in slow cooker and cook on medium/low for 8h+ 
    4. Trim excess fat from the skin - you still want some fat for the cracking, just tidy it up a bit.
    5. Rub skin with a generous handful of salt, cover and place in fridge.
    6. *Go out and enjoy your day.*

    **Crackling**

    7. Heat oven to 180°C
    8. Rinse salt off skin under a running tap and blot dry.
    9. Place skin, fat side down, on baking tray and put on top shelf of oven for 20 minutes
    10. Remove cracking from oven, drain fat and cut into strips with scissors, Turn oven up to 220°C.
    11. Return to oven for another 20-30 min
    12. *If you want the meat a bit more "roasty" - remove it from the slow cooker and place, uncovered, in the oven while the cracking finishes up.*

    **Gravy**

    13. Empty the juices from the slow cooker into a pan and heat to a simmer over a medium low heat.
    14. Add enough gravy granules to thicken.

It might not be quick - but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Slow cooked pork in soft bread buns with gravy, it's almost worth going out for the day.
