    3. Add the stock and diced chicken. Stir well.
    4. Transfer to the slow cooker and cook on low for 8h+
    5. If you're including them, pop the frozen peas in the fridge to defrost.
    6. *Go out and enjoy your day*
    
    **Finishing off**
    7. Add the peas (if using) about 30 min before you want to eat.
    8. Stir in the yogurt. 
    9. If the curry looks a little runny, mix the cornflour with a little water and add to the slow cooker, giving it a good stir.

I like mine with naan bread and some lime pickle...

Instead of peas - try adding a few handfuls of baby leaf spinach right at the end so they just have time to wilt.
