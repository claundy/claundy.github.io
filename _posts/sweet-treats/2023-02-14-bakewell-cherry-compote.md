  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 500 g frozen black cherries
    * Juice 1/2 orange
    * 2 tbsp. brandy (optional)
    * 1/2 cup sugar
    * 2 drops almond essence
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Add sugar and cherry to pan and warm gently until the cherry has defrosted and the sugar dissolved.
    2. Bring to a simmer. When the cherries start to soften (a couple of minutes should do) lift the cherries from the juice and transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon.
    3. Using the back of the slotted spoon squeeze as much of the juice as you can back into the pan.
    4. Bring the juice to a boil and reduce until it's noticeably thicker and more syrup like.
    5. Add the cherries back to the pan. Return to the boil for a minute or so.
    6. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for a few minutes.
    7. Add a couple of drops of almond essence, stir and pour into a sterilised jar.

Great with [ice cream](/sweet%20treats/2023/02/28/vanilla-ice-cream/)...

Or yogurt...

or just a spoon!

You only need a little and it keeps in the fridge for a couple of weeks.

When the juice has reduced to a syrup it gets more viscous, coating the spatula and the bubbles are noticeably bigger:
