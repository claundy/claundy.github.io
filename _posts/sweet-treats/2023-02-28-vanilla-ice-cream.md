Okay - you'll need an ice cream machine for this one...

Probably could make it without an ice cream maker, but I've never tried and probably never will.

* Without the vanilla it makes a good base for other ice cream flavours.
* If you want to add chunks (like cookie dough) then freeze them and add just before the ice cream is finished in the machine.
