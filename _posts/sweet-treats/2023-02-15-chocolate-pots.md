My take on the chocolate pudding pots from a well known, budget, supermarket.

## Notes
You don't need fancy chocolate, just supermarket own brand stuff.

You can go to town a little with the garnish:
* Mini marshmallows
* Mini-eggs
* Raspberry, fresh or freeze dried pieces.
* Dusting of icing sugar - though this doesn't keep well for long.

Like the [Lemon Posset](/sweet%20treats/2023/02/14/lemon-posset/) you can eek this out to 7 servings or so, use some kitchen scales and weigh out about 75-80g per serving.
