	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Welcome to <strong>r.eci.pe</strong> - the Coder's Kitchen,</p>
	
	<p>First off I should say this is <strong>not</strong> a blog - it's my recipe book. You won't find anecdotes or long winded stories here. </p>

	<p>I'm gradually collating and digitising my favourite recipes, mostly to share with my family, but also so I can find and work on them more easily. Over time I will also probably add some of my more "experimental" efforts - like the Oak Smoked Sour Dough I'm currently playing with.</p>
		
	<p>If you enjoy any of the recipes here, feel free to share.</p>

	<p>Cheers,</p>

	<p>Chris</p>
